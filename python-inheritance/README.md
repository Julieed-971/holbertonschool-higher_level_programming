## Objectives

- What is a superclass, baseclass or parentclass
- What is a subclass
- - How to list all attributes and methods of a class or instance
- When can an instance have new attributes
- How to inherit class from another
- How to define a class with multiple base classes
- What is the default class every class inherit from
- How to override a method or attribute inherited from the base class
- Which attributes or methods are available by heritage to subclasses
- What is the purpose of inheritance
- What are, when and how to use `isinstance`, `issubclass`, `type` and `super` built-in functions

## Description

Learning about Python inheritance.

## Requirements

### Python scripts

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files should end with a new line
- All your test files should be inside a folder `tests`
- All your test files should be text files (extension: `.txt`)
- All your tests should be executed by using this command: `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`
- All your modules should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
- All your classes should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`)
- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`)
- A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
- We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case

### Documentation

- Do not use the words `import` or `from` inside your comments, the checker will think you are trying to import some modules
