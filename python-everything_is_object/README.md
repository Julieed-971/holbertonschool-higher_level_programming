- How to know if two variables are identical
- How to know if two variables are linked to the same object
- How to display the variable identifier (which is the memory address in the CPython implementation)
- What is mutable and immutable

Write a blog post about everything you just learned / this project is covering. Your blog post should be articulated this way (one paragraph per item):

	introduction
	id and type
	mutable objects
	immutable objects
	why does it matter and how differently does Python treat mutable and immutable objects
	how arguments are passed to functions and what does that imply for mutable and immutable objects

If you worked on advanced tasks, please also include what you did learn in those tasks in the blog post.

Your posts should have many code/output examples to illustrate what you are explaining, and at least one picture, at the top. Publish your blog post on Medium or LinkedIn, and share it at least on LinkedIn.

When done, please add all urls below (blog post, LinkedIn post, etc.)

Please, remember that these blogs must be written in English to further your technical ability in a variety of settings.
